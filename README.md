# Stock Broker Client Web Dashboard

This project is a real-time stock broker client web dashboard that allows users to subscribe to stock tickers and receive live price updates. The application demonstrates the use of WebSockets for real-time communication between the backend server and the frontend client.

### Features

- User login using email.
- Subscribe to supported stocks (e.g., GOOG, TSLA, AMZN, META, NVDA).
- Real-time stock price updates without refreshing the dashboard.
- Support for multiple users who can subscribe to different stocks.
- Simultaneous updates for all users subscribed to the same stock.

### Explanation of Functionality

1. User A subscribes to AMZN:

   - When User A clicks the subscribe button for AMZN, the frontend emits a subscribe event to the backend via the Socket.io connection.
   - The backend adds User A to the AMZN room.

2. Backend emits price updates:

   - The backend continuously emits price updates for all stocks every second.
   - These updates are sent to all clients connected to the corresponding stock rooms.

3. User B subscribes to AMZN:

   - When User B subscribes to AMZN, they are also added to the AMZN room.

   * Both User A and User B receive the same real-time price updates for AMZN since they are in the same room.

4. Frontend displays price updates:

   - The frontend listens for priceUpdate events and updates the state with the new prices.
   - The updated prices are rendered in the Stock component, ensuring both users see the same prices simultaneously.
